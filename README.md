For this project I went for a minimalistic aproach. I structured the page with a presentation first, then the expirience in the related area, then titles, such as university degrees, masters... and
language levels for different languages. Finally I added the contact info to different platforms like X, instagram, mail and phone number. There's also a thim menu that's present at all times that allows
you to traverse the web page faster. It's not a very big web page because I had to make most of the things up becouse of lack of real things to add. I used a dark color scheme because I think it looked more
elecant and it`s easyer for the eyes.
